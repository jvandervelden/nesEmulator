# Nes Emulator

The end goal of this project is to emulate an Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). This is a pet project to learn how an NES functions, and to play around a bit. The intent is not to make a mainstream emulator as there are better ones out there.

## Current Status:

- 6502 Base emulation
- Ram 0x000 - 0x1FFF mapped
- Simple rom mapped at 0xFFFF - rom size to 0xFFFF. Hardcoded 6502 instructions no iNes integration.
- Instruction set tests 70% complete
